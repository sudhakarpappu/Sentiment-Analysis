# YouTube Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape comments from a YouTube video and perform sentiment analysis using `TextBlob`. The system uses **Selenium** to automate Chrome for scraping YouTube comments and **Flask** as a backend server to expose an API that takes a YouTube link and returns the sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).

## Features

- **YouTube Comment Scraper**: Uses Selenium to scrape comments dynamically from a YouTube video.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `TextBlob` to analyze the polarity of comments and classify them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- **Flask API**: A REST API that accepts YouTube links and processes the comments to return a sentiment distribution.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enables the API to work with frontend applications (like React) for seamless integration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed
- **Chrome browser** installed
- **ChromeDriver**: Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) that matches your Chrome version.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd youtube-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you update the `chromedriver.exe` path in the `app.py` to match the location of your ChromeDriver.

4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### API Endpoint

The Flask server exposes the following endpoint:

#### `POST /process_link`

- **Request**: Expects a JSON object with the YouTube video link.
  ```json
  {
    "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example_video_id"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Returns a JSON object with the sentiment breakdown.
  ```json
  {
    "most_common_sentiment": "Positive",
    "positive_count": 20,
    "neutral_count": 10,
    "negative_count": 5
  }
  ```

### Example Frontend Request

You can send a POST request from a frontend (e.g., React) to the Flask API as follows:

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:5000/process_link", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY",
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium**: For scraping YouTube comments dynamically.
- **TextBlob**: For performing sentiment analysis on the comments.
- **Flask**: For building the REST API.
- **CORS**: To enable communication between the backend and frontend.

## Future Improvements

- Support for more advanced sentiment analysis using machine learning models.
- Handle non-English comments and multi-language sentiment analysis.
- Add pagination and load more comments in the scraper.
